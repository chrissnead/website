			  <p>Lately I’ve been finding music a little distracting while trying to get work done. Luckily, podcasts have been there to help me stay focused while at the same time enjoy a great story. Podcasts can be hard to get into, especially if it isn’t a topic you necessarily care about. While in the past I’ve endured these same troubles, I was recently able to find some which I feel are actually worth a listen. I’m going to share a few of my favorites with topics on fashion, but before I do that I wanted to mention a couple non-fashion podcasts that I think deserve some recognition. We’ll call these the “honorable mentions”.</p>
			  <p>The first of these would be Ear Hustle. This podcast is recorded entirely within the walls of a prison in California and gives you the inside scoop on what a day to day life is like spent behind bars from none other than the prisoners themselves. The other is S-Town. This is not a continuous weekly/monthly podcast but a short seven-part series which follows the life of a man who lives in Woodstock, AL. I guarantee you’ll get hooked to at least one of these, but to get back on topic, here are my top 3 podcasts for fashion and inspiration:</p>

			<p>This is probably the only podcast on this list which exclusively focuses on fashion and luxury brands. What got me curious about this podcast was their episode with Oliver Spencer. I am fascinated with European tailoring and have just recently been introduced to his brand, so I thought I’d give it a try. Each podcast focuses on a company and gives in depth answers to how the founders came to create their brands as well as their personal takes on the world of fashion. I think it’s important to educate yourself on the products you wear and what makes them important to you. This podcast will help you accomplish just that and more.</p>

               		<p>James Nord is the founder of Fohr, an influencer marketing company. He does a segment on the podcast called A Drink with James in which he answers influencer’s questions about advertising, engagement, etc. I think it’s really interesting to hear all of the little details that go into building an audience which is dedicated to your content and being able to work and collaborate with brands in order to boost both theirs and your own following. If you’re trying to build your brand or this is just something that interests you, James Nord is the guy with the answers.</p>

			<p>Monocle 24 has got several great podcasts out there, but this one has to be their absolute best. I’ve been listening to their podcast for about a year now and have yet to find an episode in which I don’t enjoy. Each episode focuses on a company, how they came to be and what their purpose is. I love hearing these stories because there is always more to a product than just it’s functionality and design. Some of my favorites from this podcast are an episode with the founder of Away as well as one with the founder of the British menswear brand Universal Works. Get inspired and give this podcast a listen.</p>
